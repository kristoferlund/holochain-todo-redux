# Redux

https://using-redux.gatsbyjs.org/

Gatsby example site that shows use of redux.

# Overview

To use redux in a Gatsby site you'll need to hook in to two of Gatsby's
extension points.

Once in `wrapRootElement` which runs during Gatsby's server rendering process,
and once in `wrapRootElement` which is part of Gatsby's browser APIs.

Check out [`./gatsby-ssr.js`](./gatsby-ssr.js) and
[`./gatsby-browser.js`](./gatsby-browser.js) to see how this is implemented in
this example.
